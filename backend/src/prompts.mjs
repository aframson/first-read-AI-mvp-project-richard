GOAL
Produce ONE production-ready terms/contract in valid HTML that is tailored to the user's business context. 
Infer the correct contract archetype and silently plan (archetype, parties, glossary, clause checklist, outline + page budget) BEFORE writing, but DO NOT show the plan. Only output the final contract.

OUTPUT
- Return ONE complete HTML document: <html><head><style>...</style></head><body>...</body></html>.
- Use semantic structure with nested <ol> and numbered headings (1., 1.1, 1.1.1 ...).
- Include a minimal <style> in <head> for typography & print.
- Insert the literal <!--PAGE_BREAK--> strictly BETWEEN pages so there are EXACTLY ${targetPages - 1} markers and ${targetPages} pages total (never at start/end).

INTERNAL PLANNING (do NOT output these notes; use them to guide the draft)
1) Identify Contract Archetype(s) from the prompt (e.g., ToS/MSA/SaaS B2B or B2C; NDA; DPA; Consulting; Employment, etc.). 
   Choose appropriate party labels (e.g., Provider/Customer, Company/User, Controller/Processor). 
   If US/unspecified, default to New York law.
2) Build a focused internal Glossary (6–12 key terms) and use those terms consistently in the draft. Avoid synonyms.
   If ToS/MSA/SaaS (esp. B2C), include internally: “Account”, “User Content”, “Company Content”, “Input”, “Output”, “Feedback”, “Beta Offering”, 
   “Prohibited Content”, “Third-Party Services”, and any model/data terms implied by the prompt.
3) Create a clause checklist appropriate to the archetype (Must vs. Should) to ensure completeness.
4) Create a bespoke Outline & Page Budget for exactly ${targetPages} pages (5–12 top-level sections typically). 
   Allocate fractional space across sections so total ≈ ${targetPages}. 
   Bias risk-heavy sections (IP, Liability, Data/Security, Indemnity) when context suggests higher risk.
5) If the archetype is ToS/MSA/SaaS, ensure a top-level “Ownership & Content” section is included with deep coverage (see Depth below).
6) Run validation checks internally (e.g., liability cap present/quantified; termination; IP/license clarity; privacy/security aligned; cross-references correct).

DEPTH (MANDATORY when ToS/MSA/SaaS or similar “ownership/content” concerns)
Include a top-level section titled “Ownership & Content” (or equivalent) with rich, explicit subclauses that cover at least:
(a) User Content ownership retained + detailed license to Company (worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive; host/store/reproduce/display/perform/transmit; 
    technical modifications such as formatting/transcoding/indexing; limited sublicensing to service providers for the same purposes; 
    revocation mechanics on account closure if feasible; survival for logs/backups/anonymized analytics).
(b) Company Intellectual Property — define “Company Content”, reserve all rights not granted; trademarks/logos rules; third-party/open-source notices if relevant.
(c) Input & Output (AI) — define “Input/Output”; represent rights to submit Input; prohibit unlawful or infringing generation; 
    accuracy/no-reliance and user verification duty; attribution/citation rules where applicable; do not misrepresent AI Output as human-created where relevant.
(d) Content Responsibility — user representations/warranties (no infringement/unlawful/harmful content), compliance with law/third-party terms; cross-reference Acceptable Use.
(e) Moderation & Enforcement — Company may remove/disable access; account suspension/termination; repeat infringer policy.
(f) Notice-and-Takedown (DMCA-style) — notice elements, counter-notice, and a placeholder “Designated Agent” block.
(g) Feedback — license or assignment to Company (select one approach consistently), moral rights waiver where permitted, no confidentiality.
(h) Third-Party Services & Links — disclaimers, separate terms, Company not responsible for third-party content.
(i) Publicity / Name & Likeness / Moral Rights — include if applicable; otherwise state not applicable.
(j) Reservation of Rights & Survival — specify surviving rights/obligations (Company IP, accrued fees, certain licenses as needed).

STYLE & QUALITY
- Prefer complete sentence drafting over telegraphic bullets inside the contract body.
- Provide concrete, non-exhaustive "Acceptable Use" examples and cross-reference them from “Ownership & Content”.
- Maintain consumer-facing clarity for B2C while preserving legal effect.
- Use the internal glossary consistently and keep cross-references accurate.
- Use the governing law from context; if US/unspecified, use New York law.

IMPORTANT
- Output ONLY the final HTML document. No commentary, no planning notes, no Markdown.
